		◊p{
			For Quantum Computing @ Berkeley, I focused on relatability. The club, a brand new student organization, was 
			trying to build up its member base. In order to help with this, I tried to make the logo simple, so as to not 
			intimidate potential members. The symbol is an abstract model of a qubit (a part of a quantum computer), and 
			the typeface on the wordmark is meant to remind people of coding. Additionally, the tails on the "q" and "b" 
			resemble the brackets used to create arrays in programming.
