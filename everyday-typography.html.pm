			In Fall 2020 I led a workshop at ◊a[#:href "hex.innovativedesign.club"]{HEX}, a biannual
			event hosted by ◊a[#:href "innovativedesign.club"]{Innovative Design at Cal} (the club 
			I lead). The workshop was a mix of typography theory and implementation in the most 
			common document editor: Microsoft Word.
