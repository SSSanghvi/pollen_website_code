			A deck of playing cards that I designed from scratch, themed around diamonds and 
			featuring geometric art. Featuring muted colors and simple shapes and patterns, 
			these cards are a wonderful accent piece as well as a fully functional 54-card 
			poker regulation deck. Designed and printed in April 2017.
